# Smart-Irrigation
This project is an automated, real-time soil moisture monitoring and watering system for sustainable agriculture/gardening. It uses a NodeMCU (ESP8266) and a soil moisture sensor to detect dryness, automatically trigger a relay to start watering, and send live data to the Blynk app for remote monitoring.
